I presume that this post will be relevant mostly to small teams and very early stage startups, as larger team most probably have already put in place a system to monitor application logs. Logging is quite often overlooked at the first stages of a new project, because people believe it requires a lot of effort to set it up properly and it does not provide value immediately. However, today there are tools that make it almost trivial to put in place a very sophisticated logging framework. I'll describe the pieces of such a system for a Node/AWS application.

# What are logs
Log files are plain text files that describe

# Object vs text
One of the early decisions one needs to make if the will log

```
  log('dasdadas')
```

Use object based logging bunyan, pino, watson, pipe them


Use Kibana at AWS

Brainstorming is very important.
- What: It should happen for all API and data-structures
- How: never say ""no"". Encourage junior/shy people by asking them. Cultivate a culture of no interruptions
- Difuse naysayers. eg ""How large is the collection?"" --> We don't want to over-engineer."
- Difuse "talkers for ever"
- Difuse "I know the ultimate solutions..."
