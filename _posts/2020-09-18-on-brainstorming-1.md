“How can it be so fast”? The founder of the startup I had just started working for was both surprised and excited. The most important page of their web application, a few months on the making already, had been so painfully slow. And it was just getting slower as the user numbers increased. But suddenly, the page was really flying. “I have just added an index at the table” was my reply. Which of course led to the followup question “What is an index”?  It is often tough to explain technical issues to non-developers, but on this occasion I think I managed to come up with a decent analogy.

Brainstorming is very important.
- What: It should happen for all API and data-structures
- How: never say ""no"". Encourage junior/shy people by asking them. Cultivate a culture of no interruptions
- Difuse naysayers. eg ""How large is the collection?"" --> We don't want to over-engineer."
- Difuse "talkers for ever"
- Difuse "I know the ultimate solutions..."
